\section{What is operation research?}

There are certain problems in life that can be solved through operation research. Generaly, we try to improve certain quantifiable aspect through a decision.

These problems have a high combinatorial solution.

\section{Lean, applied to SW Ing}

First reference: Tom and Mary Poppendieck, they created the term Lean Software Development. The SW Agile manifesto is important as well:

\subsection{Values}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Individuals and relations above processes and tools
\item Working SW over excessive documentation
\item Colaboration with the client over contractual negotiations
\item Answers to change over following a plan
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Principles}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our biggest priority is to satisfy the client through early and continous delivery of valued software
\item We accept the change of requisites, even in late stages of development. Agile processes take advantage of change to give competitive advantage to the client
\item We deliver functional sw frecuently, in periods of two weeks to two months, aiming for shortest time span possible
\item Project owners and developers work together during all the project.
\item Projects are developed around motivated individuals. They must have the environment and support that they need, and they must be trusted with the work execution.
\item The most efficient method to communicate information to the development team and between its members is face to face talk
\item Functioning SW is the main measure of successe
\item Agile processes promove sustainable development. The promoters, developers and users must be capable of keeping a constant rythm for undefined periods of time
\item Continuous attention to technical excelence and good design, is what improves Agility.
\item Best architectures, requisites and designs come from self organized teams
\item The team reflects on how to be more effective in regular intervals, in order to adjust and perfect its behaviour.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Lean Software Development Principles}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Delete waste, everything that does not have value for the client
\item Amplify learning
\item Take decisions as late as possible, when we have more info
\item Deliver as fast as possible
\item Delegate responsability on the team.
\item Build with integrity.
\item Global vision: try to avoid local improvements, instead, go for a global approach.

\end{enumerate}
