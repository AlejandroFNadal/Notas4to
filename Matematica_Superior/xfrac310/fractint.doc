 As of version 16, all Fractint documentation is available online.
 Run Fractint and press F1 for the main help index.

 If you want a full documentation file (nicely formatted with table
 of contents and cross-references by page number), you can easily
 create one.
 For the MS-DOS version, type the following command at the DOS prompt:
     fractint makedoc
 The above command will overwrite the file you are now reading
 (fractint.doc) with the full Fractint documentation.

 For the Unix version, type:
     make doc
